# Equips

This menu lets you modify your current equips, and the items equipped to your B
and C-buttons. Pressing a piece of equipment that is already equipped will
unequip it. Unequpping a sword or equipping nothing to the B button will
automatically set the current file's swordless flag. **_Warning:_** Unequipping
boots will have strange effects, and usually cause an immediate crash. *Note:*
Changing a C-button equip will not modify the equipped item slot for that
button.
