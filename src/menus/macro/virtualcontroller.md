# Virtual Controller

Press the checkbox next to the controller number to override the game's input
for that controller with a virtual controller. When the virtual controller is
enabled, the **plugged in** option decides if the controller should appear to
be connected to the system. The **joystick** controls set the x and y
coordinates of the joystick on the virtual controller, and the **buttons**
controls decide what buttons are held down on the virtual controller.
