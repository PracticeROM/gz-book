# Watches

This menu lets you add custom RAM watches to observe arbitrary parts of game's
memory in real-time. Pressing the plus icon will add a new watch, and pressing
the cross next to a watch will remove that watch. After adding a watch, enter a
memory address and value type to display the value at that address. These watch
types are available:

-   **u8:** one-byte value, unsigned.
-   **s8:** one-byte value, signed.
-   **x8:** one-byte value, hexadecimal.
-   **u16:** two-byte value, unsigned.
-   **s16:** two-byte value, signed.
-   **x16:** two-byte value, hexadecimal.
-   **u32:** four-byte value, unsigned.
-   **s32:** four-byte value, signed.
-   **x32:** four-byte value, hexadecimal.
-   **f32:** four-byte value, IEEE 754 single-precision floating-point.

Pressing the anchor button next to a watch will release the watch from the
watches menu so that it's always visible, even when the menu is closed. When a
watch is released, a positioning button will appear which lets you change the
position of the watch on the screen. Holding Z when positioning the watch will
move it faster. Pressing the wrench icon next to a watch will open the memory
editor at the address of that watch. The **visible** option can be unchecked to
hide all watches globally.

Watches can be imported from text files on an SD card by pressing the folder
icon. Press a watch file to bring up a list of all watches contained in that
file. Press a watch to import it to your watch list. When you've imported all
the watches you need, press **return** to go back to the watches menu. The
format of watch files is described in the wiki,[here](./watchimportsyntax.html).
