# Cheats

This menu allows toggling the builtin cheats on and off. The following cheats
are available:

-   **energy:** Gives full health.
-   **magic:** Gives full magic.
-   **_various items:_** Sets item amounts to the current capacity of that
    item, or to one if the capacity is zero or unlimited.
-   **small keys:** Sets the number of small keys to one within the current
    dungeon, if any.
-   **rupees:** Sets the rupee amount to the capacity of the current wallet.
-   **nayru's love:** Prevents nayru's love from expiring, if active. If
    nayru's love is not currently active, entering a scene while this cheat is
    enabled will  activate it.
-   **freeze time:** Prevents the current time of day from advancing. Does not
    affect sun's song or the time of day modifiers in the file menu.
-   **no music:** Stops background music from playing.
-   **items usable:** Clears all item restriction flags, allowing all items to
    be used regardless of location.
-   **no minimap:** Keeps the minimap hidden at all times.
-   **isg:** Permanently activates the *infinite sword glitch*.
-   **quick text:** Activates fast scrolling for all textboxes.
-   **no hud:** Hides hearts, magic, buttons, rupees and the minimap overlays.

To undo the effects of the *no music*, *items usable*, *no minimap*, and *no
hud* cheats, turn the cheat off and enter a new scene, or reload the current
scene.
