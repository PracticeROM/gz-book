# Scene

Selecting **explorer** will bring up the scene explorer, which shows an overlay
of the current scene. Use the D-Pad up and down to navigate forwards and
backwards through the scene, and D-Pad left and right to rotate the view. While
holding Z, the D-Pad up and down will navigate vertically through the scene,
and D-Pad left and right will move sideways. Use the `explore prev room` and
`explore next room` commands to cycle through the rooms of the scene (bound to
`R + D-Down` and `R + D-Up` by default). Pressing L will teleport Link to the
location and orientation of the crosshair and close the scene explorer.

**set entrance point** sets Link's current position and orientation as the
point where he will respawn after voiding out. **clear flags** and **set
flags** modifies the temporary and permanent flags for the current scene, which
keep track of things such as which chests have been opened, which items have
been collected, which enemies have been defeated, etc. The **load room** option
loads the room with the specified index, if a room which such an index exists
within the current scene. If that room is already the currently loaded room,
it will be unloaded. **teleport slot** selects which
position to save and load when using the teleportation commands (this can also
be bound to a button combination, but is unbound by default). The bottom of the
scene menu shows information about the current scene.
