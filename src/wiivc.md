# Wii Virtual Console

**Windows:** Drag and drop a compatible Wii WAD onto the `patch-wad.bat`
script.

**GNU/Linux:** Run `./patch-wad <wad-file>`.

A patched WAD file will be created.
This WAD can be installed as a channel on an emulated Wii, or on a homebrew Wii
Console using a WAD manager. The original Ocarina of Time channel can be
installed alongside the patched WAD, and will not be overwritten. Homebrewing a
Wii console and using a WAD manager is not covered by this guide.
