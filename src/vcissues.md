# VC Issues

There are some known issues with the Wii VC version of gz;

-   The D-Pad on the Classic/Gamecube Controller is mapped to the L button on
    the Virtual Console. The WAD patcher remaps the D-Pad to be functional
    again, and maps C-Stick Down to L on the Virtual Console to provide access
    to the utility menu.
-   Disk features rely on the presence of the ED64 which does not exist on the
    Wii, and are therefore unavailable.
-   The scene explorer has graphical glitches due to poor emulation.
-   The reset command is not emulated correctly and has been removed.
-   The timer function is not emulated correctly and has been removed.
