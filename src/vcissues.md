# VC Issues

There are some known issues with the Wii VC version of The Practice ROM;

-   The D-Pad on the Classic/Gamecube Controller is mapped to the L button on
    the Virtual Console. The WAD patcher remaps the D-Pad to be functional
    again, and maps C-Stick Down to L on the Virtual Console to provide access
    to the utility menu.
-   The scene explorer has graphical glitches due to poor emulation.
