# Corruptions

Some assumptions are made about the state of the game when it is saved. For
example, the scene file is assumed to be largely the same as it appears on the
rom. As such, only a few details actually need to be saved. There are
situations where these assumptions break down; if the scene file had become
corrupted for some reason (e.g. double loading), those corruptions would not
be restored when the scene is loaded again.
