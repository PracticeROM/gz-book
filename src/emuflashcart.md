# Nintendo 64 Console / Emulator

**Nintendo 64 Console:** Requires a flash cart.

**Windows:** Drag and drop a compatible rom onto the `patch.bat` script.

**GNU/Linux:** Run `./patch <rom-file>`.

A patched rom will be created. It can be played with an emulator or transferred
to a flash cart. For emulator usage, you will need to enable Expansion Pak
emulation. On some emulators, you may need to change CPU Core Style to
Interpreter. For use with a flash cart, your N64 will need an Expansion Pak.
