# Introduction

This is a trainer / practice / testing utility for The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina
of Time, formally known by its codename gz, but generally referred to as
"The Practice ROM".

*Note: If you're using The Practice ROM on the Wii VC, you should read the
[VC issues](./vcissues.html) section to find out about the differences in the VC
version.*

The main interface for accessing the provided tools is the utility menu. By
default, this menu is brought up by pressing `R + L`, but this button
combination can be changed (see [Settings](./settings.html)). Use the D-Pad
to navigate the menu, and L to make a selection. For a description of each of
the submenus, see their respective section below.

Beyond the tools provided by the utility menu there is also;

-   **An input display.** The two numbers represent the x and y coordinate of
    the control stick. The button icons that appear represent the buttons that
    are pressed on the controller. *Enabled by default.*
-   **A lag counter.** Displays lag by subtracting the number of game frames
    passed from the game's vertical interrupt counter. Displayed in units of
    frames (60Hz, default), or seconds. *Disabled by default.*
-   **A timer.** Measures real-time using the CPU counter. *Disabled by
    default.*
-   **_Various button-activated commands._**
